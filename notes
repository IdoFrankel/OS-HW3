notes

should size be locked ?
if yes, there is a problem, since i sometimes use size inside locked code, 
if i relock - there will be a problem (BAD !!)


---------------
when new request arrives, should we lock the entry point, until the previous requests was placed inside a queue ?

what happens if new requets arrives, than a woriking threads end,
should we add the new request to running, or to waiting, and take one from waiting to running?
