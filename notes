in server.c

when adding new element to running queue, should it be inside a lock? yes
who can access it ? other threads who finised running.

was thinking
adding new element to running queue.
    if full, than adding new elements to waiting queue.
        if full, blocking ??
when dequeue from running queue, send signal c1, 
so the waiting threads in waiting queue will choose one and insert it to the queue, and create new thread.
